# job-scraper

## Reason for making this project:
At the time I made this, I was looking for a job. I had a list of companies I was supposed to check for new job openings every week, but reading through all of the company websites was slow, boring work. 
To solve this problem, I decided to build a webscraper that can automatically visit the companies' websites, extract information about job openings, 
filter out irrelevant jobs, check against previously found jobs, and write any new jobs both to the console (for immediate use) and to a text file (for later reference).

## Notable technologies used:
- **Selenium** for web scraping.
- **Maven** for dependency management.

## Things I would do differently next time:
There are none. Any time I thought of a possible improvement, I immediately implemented it in the project.

## Possible future expansions:
- Find a way to make it run automatically once a day or once a week.
- Make it easier to add new companies to the program. (might not be possible due to the large differences between different company websites)
