Keylane
Medior Software Engineer
A wrong system setting, server configuration error, or a NullPointerException; mistakes slip in easily. You are up to the task to locate and fix the bug! Building new software is also one of your main jobs. As Java Developer at Keylane, you mostly work with Java, SQL and Linux. Are you not familiar with Linux? No worries, you will learn fast as you follow our courses. This is how it went for Rico, who started his career two years ago after graduating as a mathematician. “A difficult task within this job? Not knowing where a bug is located. Solving these is like solving puzzles to me, that’s why I like it so much!”
